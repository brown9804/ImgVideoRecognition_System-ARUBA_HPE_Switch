The next project is carried out using an HPE idea for the electrical engineering graduation project.
The main objective is to develop an algorithm using Python and other tools such as OpenCV for the automated
review of the LEDs of a switch using a videos or images.

Each folder contains a different analysis and the media files used for tests of correct operation were added to the repositor.
If you want to find more documentation, within each stage of it you will find a folder named as docs where you will find the 
user guide and one for the developer.
